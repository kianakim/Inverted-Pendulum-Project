# Inverted-Pendulum-Project

This is a project for my 2015 high school summer internship at the University of Hawaii at Manoa College of Engineering.
Part of the 'Robotics Surgery Lab' by Prof. Peter Berkelman, w/ help from Dr. BJ Avery
(6/24/15 - current)

Using the Quanser Seesaw kit, UPM-1503 Quanser Power Module, the Lynxmotion BotBoarduino (Arduino microcontroller), and Arduino
Open-Soure Software, the goal is to create a program to balance an inverted pendulum.
